	"long_description": "Once again you feel the breath of fresh air as you find yourself standing on a stone bridge connecting the main castle to a side structure. Looking towards the castle, you realize that it had been situated at the edge of a cliff above a lake. The other side connects to the castle's annex resting on a patch of land jutting out of the water, the castle's high stone tower looming over you. As with so many other places in this castle, the giant mushrooms have made their way here, and since the bridge is only about 10 feet wide, you find moving through somewhat difficult.",
