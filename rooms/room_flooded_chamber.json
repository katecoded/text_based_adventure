	"short_description": "As you move down the corridor you notice it is flooded with a few inches of water, you eventually reach a small dark chamber with it's floor completely submerged.",
	"long_description": "The chamber is very dark aside from one torch. For the most part the floor looks like a shiny black mirror reflecting the torch light on its surface. You squint and spot a crack in the wall where the water is slowly trickling in. In one corner a patch of dirt sticks up above the water's surface. A the top of this mound you see a single blue flower.",
